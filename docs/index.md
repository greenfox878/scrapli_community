# scrapli community

This is the scrapli_community repository for [scrapli](https://github.com/carlmontanari/scrapli).

If you would like to use scrapli, but the platform(s) that you work with are not supported in the "core" scrapli
 platforms, you have come to the right place! This library is intended to be a place for scrapli users to add
  additional platform support to scrapli.
 
Please see the main [scrapli repo](https://github.com/carlmontanari/scrapli) for much more information about the main
 project.
